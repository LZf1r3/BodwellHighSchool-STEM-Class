                <p>Taiwanese sausage, known locally as "xiāngcháng" (香腸), is a beloved street food and culinary staple in Taiwan, celebrated for its sweet and savory flavor profile. Made primarily from coarsely ground pork, sugar, soy sauce, rice wine, and a blend of spices, these sausages are distinctly different from Western varieties due to their slightly sweet taste and juicy texture. Often grilled over open flames and served on skewers, or even tucked into a sticky rice bun in the popular "small sausage in large sausage" dish, Taiwanese sausage reflects the island’s rich fusion of traditional Chinese cooking and local innovation. Its popularity spans from bustling night markets to home kitchens, making it a flavorful symbol of Taiwanese food culture.</p>

            <p>Taiwanese sausage is a flavorful snack, but it’s also important to consider its nutritional content, especially for those mindful of their diet. A typical 60-gram sausage contains around 230 calories, with 18 grams of fat—including 7 grams of saturated fat—and 7 grams of protein. Its distinctive sweet taste comes in part from added sugar, contributing to about 5 grams of sugar and 8 grams of total carbohydrates. Additionally, it contains 450 milligrams of sodium, which is nearly 20% of the recommended daily intake. While Taiwanese sausage provides a moderate amount of protein and some iron, it’s best enjoyed in moderation due to its high fat and sodium levels.</p>
