                    <h1>Food and Identitys</h1>
                    <p>Food is more than just nutrition—it’s a key part of who we are. What we eat, how we prepare it, and when we share it all reflect our personal and cultural identities. Food connects people to their heritage and traditions. A single dish can carry stories of family, religion, geography, and even migration. For example, tortillas are central to many Latin American meals and have been made for thousands of years, while rice holds cultural importance across Asia, with variations in preparation and symbolism.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Dishes Around the World</h2>
            <p>Exploring traditional dishes is like taking a journey across the globe—each meal tells a story. In Japan, sushi represents a blend of fresh seafood, fermented rice, and artistic precision. In Ethiopia, injera (a sour flatbread) serves as both plate and utensil, holding flavorful stews like doro wat. Mexico offers tacos filled with grilled meats, beans, and fresh vegetables, wrapped in centuries of Indigenous and Spanish influence.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients and Flavors by Region</h2>
            <p>Every part of the world has its own flavor profile, based on the ingredients that grow there and the local cooking traditions. In Southeast Asia, for example, you’ll find bright, bold flavors—think lemongrass, ginger, coconut milk, and fish sauce. The Mediterranean diet centers on olive oil, garlic, fresh vegetables, legumes, and herbs like oregano and basil, promoting heart-healthy eating.</p>

            <h2>Respecting Food Traditions</h2>
            <p>As we learn about different cuisines, it’s important to approach them with respect and curiosity. Every food culture is rooted in history, survival, adaptation, and celebration. When we try foods from different places, we’re not just tasting something new—we’re engaging with someone else’s way of life.</p>
