                <h2>The Science of Nutrition</h2>
                <p>Nutrition is the science that studies the interactions between living organisms and the substances they consume for sustenance. It encompasses how food affects health, growth, and development.</p>
                <p>Understanding nutrition is essential for making informed dietary choices that promote overall health and well-being. It involves studying the biochemical processes that occur in the body when food is consumed, how nutrients are absorbed, and how they contribute to various bodily functions.</p>
                <p>Nutrition is not just about counting calories or following fad diets; it’s about understanding the role of different nutrients in your body and how they work together to support your health.</p>
                <p>By learning about nutrition, you can make better food choices that align with your health goals, whether that’s losing weight, building muscle, or simply feeling more energized.</p>

                <h1>Macronutrients</h1>
                <h2>What are Macronutrients?</h2>
                <iframe width="1265" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZB6qj_AcZ0" title="Macronutrients | Middle School Science | Khan Academy" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Macronutrients are the nutrients your body needs in large amounts to function properly and stay energized. The three main macronutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—each serving a different and vital purpose.</p>
                <p><b>Carbohydrates</b> are your body’s primary source of energy. They are broken down into glucose (sugar), which fuels everything from your brain to your muscles. You can find healthy carbs in foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.</p>
                <p><b>Proteins</b> are essential for building and repairing tissues. Your muscles, organs, skin, and even hormones rely on proteins to function. Good sources include meat, eggs, dairy, beans, tofu, and nuts.</p>
                <p><b>Fats</b> often get a bad reputation, but healthy fats are crucial for brain health, hormone production, and absorbing certain vitamins. Unsaturated fats, found in foods like avocados, olive oil, and fatty fish, are the best kinds to include in your diet.</p>
                <p>Balancing your intake of all three macronutrients helps maintain energy levels, build strong muscles, and support long-term health.</p>

                <h1>Micronutrients</h1>
                <h2>What are Micronutrients?</h2>
                <iframe width="1265" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JGdrLpdriJE" title="Micronutrients : basic knowledge" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that your body needs in smaller amounts but are still essential for good health. They play a crucial role in various bodily functions, including immune response, bone health, and energy production.</p>
                <p><b>Vitamins</b> are organic compounds that help regulate metabolism, support the immune system, and promote healthy skin and vision. They can be found in fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and whole grains.</p>
                <p><b>Minerals</b> are inorganic elements that assist in processes like muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and maintaining fluid balance. Important minerals include calcium, potassium, iron, and magnesium.</p>
                <p>A well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins will typically provide all the micronutrients your body needs.</p>

                <h1>Daily Food Guide</h1>
                <h2>What is the Daily Food Guide?</h2>
                <p>The Daily Food Guide is a tool designed to help individuals understand how to balance their food intake for optimal health. It emphasizes the importance of variety, moderation, and portion control.</p>
                <p>The guide typically includes recommendations for different food groups, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy. It encourages people to fill half their plate with fruits and vegetables, choose whole grains over refined grains, and include lean proteins in their meals.</p>
                <p>By following the Daily Food Guide, individuals can ensure they are getting a balanced diet that meets their nutritional needs while also enjoying a wide range of foods.</p>

                <h1>Portion Sizes & Balance</h1>
                <h2>Understanding Portion Sizes</h2>
                <p>Portion sizes refer to the amount of food you choose to eat in one sitting. Understanding portion sizes is crucial for maintaining a balanced diet and preventing overeating.</p>
                <p>Using visual cues, such as comparing a serving of meat to the size of a deck of cards or a serving of pasta to a tennis ball, can help you gauge appropriate portion sizes.</p>
                <p>Balancing your plate with the right proportions of macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—can also help you achieve your health goals. Aim for a plate that is half filled with fruits and vegetables, one-quarter with lean protein, and one-quarter with whole grains.</p>
                <p>By being mindful of portion sizes and balancing your meals, you can enjoy a variety of foods while maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>
