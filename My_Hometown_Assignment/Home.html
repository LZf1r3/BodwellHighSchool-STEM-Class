            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Brazil is the largest country in South America, covering nearly half of the continent's landmass. It shares borders with every South American country except Chile and Ecuador, and its vast territory includes a wide range of landscapes—from the dense Amazon Rainforest in the north to the open plains of the Cerrado and the wetlands of the Pantanal. The country also boasts an extensive Atlantic coastline stretching over 7,000 kilometers, dotted with major ports and coastal cities. Its diverse ecosystems make Brazil one of the most biodiverse nations on Earth, playing a crucial role in global climate regulation and conservation efforts.</p>

            <h2>Where in the world?</h2>
            <p>Brazil is located in South America and is the continent’s largest country, covering nearly half its landmass. It stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east all the way to the borders of ten other South American countries—including Argentina, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela—making it the country with the most neighbors on the continent. The Equator crosses the northern part of Brazil, giving it a tropical climate in many regions, while the Tropic of Capricorn cuts through the south. Brazil’s strategic position gives it an incredible variety of landscapes, from the lush Amazon Rainforest in the north to the rolling highlands and vibrant coastal cities in the southeast.</p>

            <p>Many people mistakenly believe that São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro is the capital of Brazil, likely because of their international fame—São Paulo as a financial hub and Rio for its iconic landmarks like Christ the Redeemer. However, the actual capital is Brasília, a planned city built in the 1960s to promote development in the country's interior. Brazil is made up of 26 states and one federal district, each with its own government and unique identity, ranging from the rainforests of Amazonas to the farmlands of Paraná. This political structure helps manage the country's vast size and diverse regions.</p>
            <p>In addition to its natural richness, Brazil has a powerful and varied economy. It is a leading exporter of agricultural products such as soybeans, coffee, beef, and sugar, supported by vast farmlands and advanced agribusiness technology. Brazil also has significant reserves of minerals, oil, and natural gas, making mining and energy key sectors. Its industrial base is strong, producing everything from airplanes to automobiles. With a growing service sector and a large domestic market, Brazil remains one of the largest economies in the world and a vital player in global trade and environmental discussions.</p>
