            <h1 class="TopicTitle">What are dreams and why they fascinate us</h1>
            <p>Dreams are vivid experiences that occur in our minds while we sleep, often involving images, sounds, emotions, and even stories. Most dreams happen during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, a phase where the brain is highly active—almost as much as when we’re awake. Although dreams can feel incredibly real, they’re entirely created by our subconscious. Some are strange or confusing, while others are peaceful, exciting, or even terrifying.</p>
            <p>What makes dreams especially fascinating is that no one fully understands them. Scientists, psychologists, and philosophers have studied dreams for centuries, yet they remain one of the most mysterious aspects of the human mind. Some theories suggest that dreams help us process emotions, store memories, or solve problems we face in waking life. Others believe dreams are just random brain activity, like a movie made from scattered thoughts.</p>
            <p>People have always been curious about what dreams mean. In ancient cultures, dreams were believed to carry messages from the gods or predict the future. Today, many people still find meaning in their dreams, using them to explore feelings or gain insight into their lives. Whether or not they have hidden messages, dreams often feel important because they connect us with thoughts and feelings we might not notice during the day.</p>
            <p>Another reason we’re fascinated by dreams is their creativity. Our minds can create entire worlds while we sleep—places we’ve never seen, people we’ve never met, and scenarios that defy logic. Dreams can feel like personal movies, full of symbolism and imagination. For writers, artists, and even scientists, dreams have sparked new ideas, inventions, and works of art.</p>
            <p>In the end, dreams fascinate us because they are deeply personal, often mysterious, and sometimes beautiful. They blur the line between reality and imagination, giving us a glimpse into the incredible power of the human mind. Whether you see them as messages, memories, or just mental noise, dreams remind us that our minds are always working—day and night.</p>

        <h1 class=TopicTitle>Interesting Facts</h1>
        <h3 class="inline-only">Dreams are more than just random thoughts while we sleep — they’re mysterious, creative, and sometimes even mind-blowing. Scientists are still uncovering how and why we dream, but what we do know is full of surprises. Below are some fascinating facts about dreams that show just how strange and amazing our sleeping minds can be.</h3>

                <h4>Most Dreams Are Forgotten Within Minutes</h4>
                <img class="rounded-box" src="Images/Crazy_Dream_1.png" alt="Dream Image LOL">
                <p>Have you ever had a powerful or strange dream, only to forget it minutes after waking up? That’s completely normal—people forget about 90% of their dreams within 5 minutes of waking. The brain doesn’t store most dream memories the same way it does waking memories, making them vanish quickly unless you write them down or focus hard on remembering.</p>

                    <h4>You Can’t Tell Time or Read in Dreams</h4>
                    <img class="rounded-box" src="Images/Crazy_Dream_2.png" alt="Dream Image LOL">
                    <p>If you ever try to read a book or check a clock in a dream, you’ll notice it usually doesn’t work. That’s because your brain can’t properly process text or exact time in dreams. Words may blur, change constantly, or just not make sense. Clocks might show nonsense numbers or shift every time you look away.</p>

                    <h4>Some People Dream in Black and White</h4>
                    <img class="rounded-box" src="Images/Crazy_Dream_3.png" alt="Dream Image LOL">
                    <p>While most people dream in color, around 12% of people dream only in black and white. Interestingly, this number was much higher in the early 20th century—before color television—suggesting that media and culture might influence how we dream. Today, black-and-white dreams are rare but still fascinating!</p>

                    <h4>You Spend About Six Years of Your Life Dreaming</h4>
                    <img class="rounded-box" src="Images/Crazy_Dream_4.png" alt="Dream Image LOL">
                    <p>It might sound unbelievable, but the average person spends about six full years of their life dreaming. With multiple REM cycles each night and thousands of dreams each year, those minutes really add up. Even if we forget most of them, our brains are busy creating stories every night.</p>

        <h1 class=TopicTitle>Dreams and Sleep Disorders</h1>
        <h3 class="inline-only">Dreams can be fascinating, but they can also be affected by sleep disorders. These disorders can disrupt our sleep patterns and impact the quality of our dreams. Here are some common sleep disorders that can influence dreaming:</h3>
        <section id="SleepDisorders">
            <div class="SleepDisorder">
                <h4>Insomnia</h4>
                <img class="rounded-box" src="Images/Crazy_Dream_5.png" alt="Dream Image LOL">
                <p>Insomnia is a condition where people have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. This can lead to fragmented sleep and may result in less REM sleep, which is when most dreaming occurs. As a result, people with insomnia may experience fewer dreams or have difficulty remembering them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="SleepDisorder">
                <h4>Sleep Apnea</h4>
                <img class="rounded-box" src="Images/Crazy_Dream_6.png" alt="Dream Image LOL">
                <p>Sleep apnea is a disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. This can lead to disrupted sleep and reduced REM sleep, affecting the quality of dreams. People with sleep apnea may experience more nightmares or vivid dreams due to the fragmented nature of their sleep.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="SleepDisorder">
                <h4>Nightmares</h4>
                <img class="rounded-box" src="Images/Crazy_Dream_7.png" alt="Dream Image LOL">
                <p>Nightmares are intense, frightening dreams that can cause feelings of fear or anxiety. They often occur during REM sleep and can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or trauma. People who experience frequent nightmares may have difficulty sleeping and may feel tired during the day.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="SleepDisorder">
                <h4>Sleepwalking</h4>
                <img class="rounded-box" src="Images/Crazy_Dream_8.png" alt="Dream Image LOL">
                <p>Sleepwalking is a disorder where people walk or perform other activities while still asleep. This can lead to unusual behaviors during sleep, and the person may not remember these actions upon waking. Sleepwalking can disrupt sleep and may result in less REM sleep, affecting the quality of dreams.</p>
