        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each team has 11 players: 10 field players and 1 goalkeeper.</li>
            <li>The match lasts 90 minutes, split into two halves of 45 minutes each.</li>
            <li>A goal is scored when the whole ball crosses the goal line between the posts.</li>
            <li>Players cannot use their hands, except goalkeepers inside their own penalty area.</li>
            <li>The offside rule prevents attackers from gaining unfair advantages.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fouls and Free Kicks</h3>
        <p>Common fouls include tripping, pushing, or handling the ball deliberately. When a foul occurs, the referee may award a direct or indirect free kick, or a penalty kick if it happens in the penalty box.</p>
        <h3>Cards</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Yellow card:</strong> A warning for unsporting behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Red card:</strong> The player is sent off and cannot be replaced.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Throw-ins, Goal Kicks, and Corner Kicks</h3>
        <p>These restart the game when the ball goes out of play. The team that didn't touch the ball last gets possession.</p>
