        <h2>History of Football</h2>
        <p>Ancient civilizations such as China (cuju), Greece, and Rome played early forms of football. The modern version was formalized in 1863 when the Football Association (FA) in England was founded. This marked the split between soccer and rugby. The first international match occurred in 1872 between England and Scotland. FIFA, the international governing body, was established in 1904, and the first FIFA World Cup was held in 1930 in Uruguay.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, football evolved with tactics, formations, and global tournaments. Today, events like the FIFA World Cup and UEFA Champions League are watched by billions worldwide.</p>
